Securing Istio-based apps with Keycloak

Over the years advanced application features, such as Circuit Breaking, Telemetry or Security, used to be embedded directly into the application. Istio changed the way we build our systems by those features into the platform, where they belong. This allows application developers to be more productive and focus on solving business problems. During the session we will focus on one of the hardest problems in development process - applying Security. We will dive into JWT and TLS standards to see how they fit into modern applications.
